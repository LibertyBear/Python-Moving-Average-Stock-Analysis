# Python-Moving-Average-Stock-Analysis
Graphically displays buy/sell (as well as golden/death crosses) based on the moving-average analysis. 

main2.py is the same as main.py, but it works with subplots, showing various stocks at once, and has an input functionality that lets the user pick all the variables.
